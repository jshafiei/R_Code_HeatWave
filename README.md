# R_HeatWave_Ambient_Temperature
This code calculates heatwave properties based on maximum and minimum daily temperatures. Accordingly, a heatwave (HW1) is defined as at least two consecutive days with both maximum and minimum temperatures more than X percentile of historical maximum and minimum data. These properties/components are:

1-Number of Hot Days: A hot day is defined as a day with both minimum and maximum daily temperatures above thresholds.
2-Severity of hot days (Above minimum): The cumulative temperatures of minimum temperature above the minimum threshold during hot days in each year
3-Severity of hot days (Above maximum): The cumulative temperatures of maximum temperature above the maximum threshold during hot days in each year

4-Number of Heatwaves
5-Total length of heatwaves
6-Longest heatwaves

7-Severity of heatwaves(Above minimum): The cumulative temperatures of minimum temperature above the minimum threshold during heatwaves in each year
8-Severity of heatwaves(Above maximum): The cumulative temperatures of maximum temperature above the maximum threshold during heatwaves in each year
9-First day for heatwave 
10-Last day for heatwave
